Scientific-Python-Snippets
(formaly mini-tests)

A curated collection of small, reusable Python scripts for common data handling, file manipulation, and automation tasks. This repository serves as a personal library of snippets and utilities, often incorporating simple graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with Tkinter for ease of use.

Usage

 Features
This toolkit provides scripts to perform a variety of common tasks, including:

GUI Interaction: File and folder selection dialogs using Tkinter.

Data Parsing: Reading and cleaning data from structured text and CSV files.

Batch Processing: Applying an operation (like stripping headers) to all files in a directory.

Data Generation: Creating sample datasets for testing and simulation.

Command Generation: Automating the creation of shell commands for programs like gnuplot and pip.

Interactive Plotting: Selecting and annotating data points directly on a matplotlib graph.

 Dependencies
The scripts in this repository primarily rely on the following standard Python libraries. To run all scripts, ensure you have them installed:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib

Note: tkinter is part of the standard Python library and typically does not require a separate installation.

 Script Descriptions
Here is a brief overview of each script included in this toolkit:

Filename

Description

csv_file_picker.py

Opens a GUI dialog to select a single .csv file and returns its absolute path.

generate_gnuplot_script.py

Asks the user for a folder and generates a gnuplot command to plot data from all files within it.

generate_local_pip_commands.py

Asks the user for a folder and generates offline pip install commands for all package files found.

generate_squared_data.py

Creates a sample two-column dataset (y = xÂ²) and saves it to a structured text file.

gui_file_lister.py

Opens a GUI dialog to select a folder and prints the full path of every file within it recursively.

interactive_data_picker.py

Displays an interactive matplotlib plot where users can click to select and annotate data points.

lcr_data_parser.py

A batch processor that extracts specific columns of data from LCR meter files in a directory.

numpy_range_examples.py

A reference script demonstrating different methods to generate numerical sequences with NumPy.

strip_file_headers.py

(Destructive) Removes the first two lines from every file in a specified directory.

strip_header_single_file.py

Removes the first two lines from a specific file and saves the result to a new file.

timestamped_filename_generator.py

Runs an infinite loop that continuously prints unique, timestamped filenames to the console.
