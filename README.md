# Scientific-Python-Snippets
> (Formerly Mini-Tests)

A curated collection of small, reusable Python scripts for common data handling, file manipulation, and automation tasks. This repository serves as a personal library of snippets and utilities, often incorporating simple graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with Tkinter for ease of use.

## Features
This toolkit provides scripts to perform a variety of common tasks, including:

* **GUI Interaction**: File and folder selection dialogs using `Tkinter`.
* **Data Parsing**: Reading and cleaning data from structured text and CSV files.
* **Batch Processing**: Applying an operation (like stripping headers) to all files in a directory.
* **Data Generation**: Creating sample datasets for testing and simulation.
* **Command Generation**: Automating the creation of shell commands for programs like `gnuplot` and `pip`.
* **Interactive Plotting**: Selecting and annotating data points directly on a `matplotlib` graph.

## Dependencies
The scripts in this repository primarily rely on the following standard Python libraries. To run all scripts, ensure you have them installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
